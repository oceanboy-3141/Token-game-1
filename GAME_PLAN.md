# Token Synonym Game - Project Plan

## Research Objective
**Primary Goal**: Investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) place synonyms similarly in token space by analyzing token IDs.

**Research Question**: Do synonyms have similar/close token IDs in the tokenization space?

## Game Concept

### Core Gameplay
- **Genre**: Educational word puzzle game (inspired by New York Times games)
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Display a target word with its token ID and educational context
  - Player explores word relationships through semantic similarity and token space proximity
  - Multiple game modes: Classic (find similar words), Antonym (find opposites), Category-focused
  - Smart scoring system with visual feedback and educational explanations
  - Progressive hint system teaching both semantic relationships and tokenization concepts

### Research Integration
- Each gameplay session generates data about:
  - Which words players associate as "similar" 
  - Actual token ID distances between chosen words
  - Whether human intuition about word similarity aligns with tokenization similarity

## Technical Requirements

### Core Dependencies
```python
import tiktoken

# Primary encoding to use
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("o200k_base")

# Alternative: Model-specific encoding
enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o")

# Installation
pip install tiktoken
```

### Key Technical Features
- Advanced token encoding/decoding with educational explanations
- Interactive token space visualization and distance calculation
- Intelligent word input validation with multi-token support
