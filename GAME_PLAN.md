# Token Synonym Game - Project Plan

## Research Objective
**Primary Goal**: Investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) place synonyms similarly in token space by analyzing token IDs.

**Research Question**: Do synonyms have similar/close token IDs in the tokenization space?

## Game Concept

### Core Gameplay
- **Genre**: Word puzzle game (inspired by New York Times games)
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Display a target word on screen (preferably single token, but multi-token allowed)
  - Player must find/guess a word with the **closest token ID** to the target word
  - Scoring based on how close the guessed token ID is to the target token ID

### Research Integration
- Each gameplay session generates data about:
  - Which words players associate as "similar" 
  - Actual token ID distances between chosen words
  - Whether human intuition about word similarity aligns with tokenization similarity

## Technical Requirements

### Core Dependencies
```python
import tiktoken

# Primary encoding to use
enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("o200k_base")

# Alternative: Model-specific encoding
enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o")

# Installation
pip install tiktoken
```

### Key Technical Features
- Token encoding/decoding functionality
- Token ID comparison and distance calculation
- Word input validation
- Score calculation based on token ID proximity

## Development Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (Current - Cursor Development)
- **Focus**: Core functionality over graphics
- **Goal**: Proof of concept and initial data collection
- **Graphics**: Minimal, functional UI

### Phase 2: Polish (Future - Replit Development)
- **Focus**: Enhanced UI/UX and graphics
- **Goal**: Refined user experience

## Game Flow Design

1. **Start Screen**: Game explanation and research context
2. **Main Game**: 
   - Display target word
   - Show target word's token ID (optional - for transparency)
   - Input field for player's guess
   - Submit and feedback system
3. **Scoring/Feedback**:
   - Show guessed word's token ID
   - Calculate and display ID distance
   - Provide encouragement/scoring
4. **Data Collection**: Log word pairs and ID distances for research

## Data Points to Collect
- Target word and its token ID
- Player's guessed word and its token ID  
- Token ID distance/difference
- Timestamp and session info
- Player's reasoning (optional feedback)

## Success Metrics
- **Gameplay**: Engaging and educational experience
- **Research**: Clear patterns in synonym token ID clustering
- **Data Quality**: Sufficient data points for meaningful analysis

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Set up basic Python environment with tiktoken
2. ‚úÖ Create simple command-line prototype
3. ‚úÖ Build basic GUI interface
4. ‚úÖ Implement scoring system
5. ‚úÖ Add data logging functionality
6. ‚úÖ Test with initial word sets
7. ‚úÖ Enhanced hint system with contextual suggestions
8. ‚úÖ Expanded word categories and difficulty levels
9. ‚úÖ Added progress bars and visual feedback

## üöÄ Completed Immediate Improvements (Phase 1.5)

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Hint System
- **Contextual hints** based on word categories (emotions, size, speed, etc.)
- **Suggested word buttons** that can be clicked to auto-fill
- **Token range information** showing nearby token IDs
- **Interactive hint window** with better UX

### ‚úÖ Better Scoring Visualization
- **Progress bars** showing game completion and round attempts
- **Enhanced visual feedback** with colored results
- **Real-time progress updates** as players make guesses

### ‚úÖ Word List Expansion
- **8 semantic categories**: emotions, size, speed, quality, temperature, brightness, actions, difficulty
- **3 difficulty levels** per category: easy, medium, hard
- **Synonym/antonym pairs** for research analysis
- **120+ total words** vs original 48 words

## üîß Medium-term Enhancements (Phase 2)

### ü§ù Multiplayer/Social Features
- **Share results** with friends via exportable summaries
- **Local leaderboards** stored in game data
- **"Word of the day"** challenges with special scoring
- **Session comparison** tools to track improvement

### üéÆ Advanced Game Modes
- **Antonym Mode**: Find words with maximum token distance (opposite meanings)
- **Category Mode**: All words from same semantic category (emotions only, etc.)
- **Speed Mode**: Time-based challenges with countdown timers
- **Explorer Mode**: Let players choose their own target words
- **Difficulty Settings**: Choose easy/medium/hard word sets
- **Custom Word Lists**: Allow users to add their own word categories

### üìä Research Dashboard
- **Real-time data visualization** showing distance patterns
- **Pattern discovery tools** to find semantic clusters

- **LLM validation**: Use actual language models to validate semantic similarity
- **Embedding comparison**: Compare token distance vs. embedding similarity (cosine similarity)
- **Intelligent hints**: Generate contextual hints using GPT-4 based on semantic relationships
- **Semantic scoring**: Bonus points for semantically similar words regardless of token distance
- **Dynamic difficulty**: AI adjusts word difficulty based on player performance

### üìö Educational Features
- **Tutorial mode** explaining tokenization concepts step-by-step
- **Insights panels** showing how LLMs "see" language through tokens
- **Mini-lessons** on linguistics, NLP, and language model architecture
- **Research explanations** of why token clustering matters
